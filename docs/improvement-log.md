# Improvement log

## 12 September 2026: publishing recovery

The last successful Pages deployment was on 1 July at 07:00 UTC, commit
`8efe99c`. The next prompt-library commit introduced a stray Markdown wrapper
inside YAML frontmatter. The latest Pages failure and the 1 September Feral
failure both identify that same file. Repository content continued to 3 July.

The recovery removes the misplaced wrappers, parses generated prompt files
individually, rejects truncated or malformed batches, validates actual YAML
before publication and adds a content check to PR and deployment workflows.
It also establishes the recurring improvement brief and checkpoint.

Validation: all 406 Markdown files parse, all 82 bot tests pass, and the
production build produces 877 pages. Model data validation passes. The Horizon
validator has no errors and reports 15 genuinely overdue forecast reviews.
Deployment verification follows the PR checks.

We're seeing the infrastructure mature. Less hype about capabilities, more focus on making things actually work.

## DeepMind lets algorithms evolve themselves

Google DeepMind researchers used semantic evolution to automatically create [better variants of reinforcement learning algorithms](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/24/google-deepmind-researchers-apply-semantic-evolution-to-create-non-intuitive-vad-cfr-and-shor-psro-variants-for-superior-algorithmic-convergence/) like CFR and PSRO. Instead of humans manually tweaking parameters, they let the system explore the combinatorial space and discover non-intuitive improvements. This matters because it shows we can automate the research process itself, not just the applications.

## RAG wins against context stuffing

Despite massive context windows, [selective retrieval still beats dumping everything into prompts](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/24/rag-vs-context-stuffing-why-selective-retrieval-is-more-efficient-and-reliable-than-dumping-all-data-into-the-prompt/). Turns out bigger context doesn't solve the fundamental problems of relevance and cost. Smart filtering remains more important than raw capacity, which makes sense if you've tried to get useful answers from a model drowning in irrelevant data.

## OpenAI ships WebSocket mode for voice

OpenAI launched [WebSocket connections for real-time voice interactions](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/23/beyond-simple-api-requests-how-openais-websocket-mode-changes-the-game-for-low-latency-voice-powered-ai-experiences/), ditching the clunky STT-LLM-TTS pipeline. This is the kind of infrastructure upgrade that makes voice AI actually usable instead of feeling like a demo. The latency improvements should make conversational agents feel more natural.

## Composio builds better agent orchestration

Composio open-sourced [Agent Orchestrator to move beyond simple ReAct loops](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/23/composio-open-sources-agent-orchestrator-to-help-ai-developers-build-scalable-multi-agent-workflows-beyond-the-traditional-react-loops/). Finally, someone's tackling the brittleness problem that kills most agent deployments. Multi-agent workflows need proper orchestration, not just chains of think-act-observe cycles that break under real-world complexity.

## Anthropic calls out Chinese model distillation

Anthropic accused DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax of [using 24,000 fake accounts to distill Claude's capabilities](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/anthropic-accuses-chinese-ai-labs-of-mining-claude-as-us-debates-ai-chip-exports/) through 16 million queries. This is the new normal for model competition. Export controls on chips just mean everyone's competing on data extraction and training efficiency instead.

The big theme this week is fixing AI's memory problem. Several teams are tackling the ephemeral agent issue with different approaches.

## Microsoft's CORPGEN manages dozens of concurrent tasks

[Microsoft Research introduced CORPGEN](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/26/microsoft-research-introduces-corpgen-to-manage-multi-horizon-tasks-for-autonomous-ai-agents-using-hierarchical-planning-and-memory/), a framework for handling what they call "Multi-Horizon Task Management." Instead of single-shot benchmarks, this tackles realistic corporate work where agents juggle dozens of interleaved tasks with complex dependencies. The hierarchical planning approach could finally make AI assistants useful for actual work environments.

## Nous Research fixes AI forgetfulness with Hermes Agent

[Nous Research released Hermes Agent](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/26/nous-research-releases-hermes-agent-to-fix-ai-forgetfulness-with-multi-level-memory-and-dedicated-remote-terminal-access-support/) to solve the "ephemeral agent" problem. It adds multi-level memory and persistent state so your AI doesn't restart its cognitive clock every chat session. The remote terminal access is interesting too, suggesting they're building toward actual autonomous teammates rather than just chatbots.

## Google's Nano-Banana 2 hits sub-second 4K image synthesis

[Google released Nano-Banana 2](https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/02/26/google-ai-just-released-nano-banana-2-the-new-ai-model-featuring-advanced-subject-consistency-and-sub-second-4k-image-synthesis-performance/) with sub-second 4K image generation that runs entirely on device. The pivot toward edge computing makes sense, but the real test is whether subject consistency finally works reliably. Fast generation is useless if you can't maintain character identity across images.

## Anthropic acquires Vercept after founder drama

[Anthropic bought computer-use startup Vercept](https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/25/anthropic-acquires-vercept-ai-startup-agents-computer-use-founders-investors/) after Meta poached one of its founders. The timing suggests Anthropic is serious about competing in the computer-use agent space. Vercept's tools for controlling applications like a human could give Claude a significant advantage over competitors.

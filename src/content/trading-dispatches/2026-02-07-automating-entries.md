The hardest part of trading isn't the strategy. It's the execution. You see the setup, you know the rules, and then your brain starts negotiating.

"Maybe I should wait for confirmation."
"That candle looks a bit weak."
"What if it reverses?"

By the time you've finished arguing with yourself, the move has happened without you.

## Bots don't hesitate

An automated system sees the breakout, checks the filters, and places the order. No second-guessing, no emotional overrides, no "I'll get the next one." It does what the rules say, every time.

That consistency is the real edge. A slightly worse strategy executed perfectly will beat a great strategy executed badly. And humans execute badly more often than they'd like to admit.

## The tradeoff

You lose the ability to use discretion. Sometimes a human would have spotted something the bot missed. But on balance, removing the human from execution has been a net positive for me.

A raw ORB strategy trades every breakout. That's a lot of trades, and a lot of noise. Edge filters are the extra checks that help you only take the setups that have something going for them.

## Gap filter

If the market gaps in the same direction as the breakout, that's confluence. A stock opens below yesterday's close and then breaks below the opening range? Sellers are in control. That's a better setup than a random breakout into nowhere.

## Cross-instrument confirmation

If UK 100 is breaking out to the upside and US Tech 100 is also showing strength, there's broader support for the move. If one is going up while the other is going down, something's messy. Best to sit that one out.

## Range size

Too narrow and you'll get stopped out on noise. Too wide and the risk/reward doesn't work. There's a sweet spot in the middle where the range is meaningful but the stop distance is still manageable.

None of these filters are perfect on their own. Stacked together, they filter out a decent chunk of the garbage.

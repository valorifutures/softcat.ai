The ORB (Opening Range Breakout) trading bot is now running live on a demo account, covering three sessions:

- **Japan 225** — 00:00 UK time
- **UK 100** — 08:00 UK time
- **US Tech 100** — 14:30 UK time

The system uses Lightstreamer for real-time price streaming, with edge filters for gap alignment and cross-instrument confirmation. Risk is capped at 2.5% per trade.

Early results are being tracked in a SQLite journal. Performance summaries will appear here as the bot accumulates data.

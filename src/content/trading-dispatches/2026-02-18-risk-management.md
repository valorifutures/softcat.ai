Everyone wants to talk about entries. Nobody wants to talk about how much they're risking per trade. That's the wrong way round.

## The 2% rule (roughly)

I risk around 2.5% of the account per trade. If the account is 10,000, that's 250 at risk. The stop distance determines the position size, not the other way around. If the stop needs to be wide, the position gets smaller. Simple maths.

## Why it matters

A bad streak of 5 losses in a row with 2.5% risk means you're down about 12%. Painful, but recoverable. The same streak at 10% risk means you've lost 40%. That's a hole most people don't climb out of.

## The psychological side

Small position sizes are easier to manage mentally. You don't panic, you don't move your stop, you don't close early. You let the trade play out because losing one doesn't wreck your week. That calmness is worth more than any clever entry signal.

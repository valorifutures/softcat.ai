The Opening Range Breakout (ORB) is one of the oldest intraday strategies going. The idea is simple: wait for the market to open, watch the first 5-30 minutes to establish a range, then trade the breakout when price pushes above or below that range.

## Why does it work?

The opening range captures the initial battle between buyers and sellers as overnight orders get filled. Once that range resolves, the breakout direction often sets the tone for the session.

It's not magic. It works because the open is when most volume and volatility hits the market. A clean break of that range with momentum behind it tends to follow through.

## The catch

Not every breakout is real. Fakeouts happen, especially in choppy markets. That's why edge filters matter. Things like gap direction, cross-instrument confirmation, and range size all help sort the good setups from the noise.

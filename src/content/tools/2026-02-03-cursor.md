Cursor takes VS Code and bolts an AI layer on top. Tab to accept autocomplete suggestions, chat with your codebase, generate code inline. It feels like what GitHub Copilot should have been.

The standout feature is the chat that actually understands your project. It indexes your files and gives answers in context, not generic responses. Ask it about your codebase and it'll reference actual functions and files.

Free tier is usable but limited. The Pro tier at $20/month is where it gets serious.

**Why we use it:** Most of the workshop experiments start here. The inline completions catch patterns faster than typing them.

**Verdict:** Best AI code editor right now. Not close.

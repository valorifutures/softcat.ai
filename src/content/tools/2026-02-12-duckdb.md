DuckDB is SQLite's analytical cousin. Where SQLite is great for transactional stuff, DuckDB is built for crunching data. Aggregations, joins across big tables, columnar storage. All in-process, no server needed.

The Python integration is excellent. Import it, point it at a CSV or Parquet file, run SQL. It'll happily chew through millions of rows on a laptop. You can even query Pandas DataFrames directly with SQL.

I've started using it instead of Pandas for anything involving aggregation or filtering. The SQL is clearer than chained DataFrame operations, and it's usually faster too. Worth a look if you're doing any kind of data analysis in Python.

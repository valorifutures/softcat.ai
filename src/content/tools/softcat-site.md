The site you're looking at. Built with:

- **Astro 5** — static site generator with content collections
- **Tailwind CSS 4** — utility-first styling
- **Cloudflare Pages** — free hosting with auto-deploy from Git
- **Claude Code CLI** — used to build and maintain the site from the terminal

The content pipeline (Phase 2) will add a Python bot that generates markdown content from various data sources and pushes it to the repo automatically.

The repo is the site. No CMS, no database, no drag-and-drop builder.

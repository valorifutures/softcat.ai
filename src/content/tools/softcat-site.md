The site you're looking at. Built with:

- **Astro 5** for static site generation and content collections
- **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling
- **GitHub Pages** for free hosting with auto-deploy from Git
- **Claude Code CLI** for building and maintaining from the terminal

Next up is a Python bot that generates markdown content from various data sources and pushes it to the repo automatically.

The repo is the site. No CMS, no database, no drag-and-drop builder.

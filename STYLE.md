# SOFT CAT House Style

**SOFT CAT = Smart Outputs From Trained Conversational AI Technology**

This is the mantra. Every piece of content on this site must reflect it. The site is an AI workshop. All content should be about AI: models, tools, experiments, techniques, agents, prompting, infrastructure for AI. This applies to everything, whether written by a human or generated by a bot.

## Identity: Valori
- The site is maintained by **Valori**, an anonymous collective.
- Always "we" never "I". No individual names, no personal attribution.
- No member bios, headshots, or LinkedIn links.
- Expertise is demonstrated through the work, not credentials.
- Tone: knowledgeable insiders, not thought leaders.

## Voice
- Write like a human. Short sentences. Casual but not sloppy.
- Always use collective voice. "We built this" not "I built this".
- Be direct. Say what happened, what it does, what's next.

## Formatting
- No em dashes. Use commas, full stops, or rewrite the sentence.
- No semicolons unless it's code.
- Keep paragraphs short. Two to three sentences max.
- Use bullet points for lists, not long prose.

## Words to avoid
- "Leveraging", "utilising", "comprehensive", "robust", "seamless"
- "In order to" (just say "to")
- "It's worth noting that" (just say the thing)
- "Delve", "tapestry", "landscape"

## Structure
- Lead with the point. Don't build up to it.
- Summaries should be one sentence, not a paragraph.
- Tags should be lowercase, hyphenated, specific.

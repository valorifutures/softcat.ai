# SOFT CAT House Style

Rules for all content on this site, whether written by a human or generated by a bot.

## Voice
- Write like a human. Short sentences. Casual but not sloppy.
- First person is fine. "I built this" not "this was built".
- Be direct. Say what happened, what it does, what's next.

## Formatting
- No em dashes. Use commas, full stops, or rewrite the sentence.
- No semicolons unless it's code.
- Keep paragraphs short. Two to three sentences max.
- Use bullet points for lists, not long prose.

## Words to avoid
- "Leveraging", "utilising", "comprehensive", "robust", "seamless"
- "In order to" (just say "to")
- "It's worth noting that" (just say the thing)
- "Delve", "tapestry", "landscape"

## Structure
- Lead with the point. Don't build up to it.
- Summaries should be one sentence, not a paragraph.
- Tags should be lowercase, hyphenated, specific.
